# Railway_Announcement
I made this project  “Indian Railway Announcement System” using python. Which can generate railway announcements .mp3 file automatically.
I used Virtual Studio Code IDE for this project.

For creating this railway announcement software,I have used a bunch of modules like pyaudio, pydub, and gTTS to process audio and get the announcing status of thousands of trains. By using PyAudio module, we can easily use Python to play and record audio on a variety of platforms. Pydub is a simple and well-designed Python module for audio manipulation and gTTS (which stands for Google Text-to-Speech) is a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate text-to-speech API.

The pre-requirements to build this project :
  1. A sample Railway announcement mp3 file from which we will generate our skeleton mp3 files.
  2. A Excel file, which will contain all the required details of trains.
